#enlighten: Browser-controlled LED effects
##What is enlighten?
enlighten allows you to control all your lighting applications using a Raspberry Pi. It supports effect programming via web browser and controls LED strips, multicolor light bulbs or whatever device you imagine - just create a new block in Python and HTML!
##Can I already use it?
This project is at a very early stage and requires a lot of work to get it up and running on your Raspberry. Feel free to fork!
